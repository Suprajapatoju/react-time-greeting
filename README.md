# React Time Greeting

This is a simple React project that displays a greeting based on the time of day. It shows:
- "Good Morning" (red color) if the time is before 12 PM.
- "Good Afternoon" (green color) if the time is between 12 PM and 6 PM.
- "Good Evening" (blue color) if the time is after 6 PM.
